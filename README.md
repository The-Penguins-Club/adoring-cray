bash version of docker names generator.

While we get an idea we usually jump into coding/hacking the feature. Most of the members of our club is young as of now so that is expected. And for that we need project name which we are bad at doing. So to keep the momentum of the project we usually start with a two word code name and the give a proper name down the line. 

That is where this tools comes in. We love the names generator used by docker and we say a port of it exists in many language like JS, TS, python and rust but not in bash.

We jumped into hacking and voil√†!

Now we can spend less time naming things and start hacking on them. In fact, the repo name for this project was generated by the script.
